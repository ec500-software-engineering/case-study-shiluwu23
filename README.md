Case Study Project: Tensorflow
## 1.	Technology and Platform
a.	Language used: C++/Python
TensorFlow is designed to support multiple client languages. Currently, Python is chosen as the first well-supported language for expressing and controlling the training of models and python supports the most features. However, the core of TensorFlow is written in a combination of highly-optimized C++ and CUDA (Nvidia's language for programming GPUs).

If the project was started today, I would still use python and C++ as the coding languages. Since C++ offers speed and performance, and python is easy to integrate and itâ€™s helpful for building Machine Learning Applications from its inception to deployment.
b.	Environment needed: Anaconda.
c.	frameworks / libraries: TensorFlow, Pandas, TensorFlow-gpu, etc.
## 2.	Testing
One of the easiest ways to get started using TensorFlow Serving is with Docker. With Docker, we can manage our infrastructure in the same ways we manage your applications. Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of our containers: Develop the application and its supporting components using containers. The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing our application.
### CI platform
Since TensorFlow is a cross-platform tool that can run on CPU and GPU hardware, the maintainers have set up multiple pipelines to build and test the tool on different operating system platforms and CPU/GPU configurations. Their pipelines are built using Jenkins.

MacOS, Linux,, Windows, Raspberry Pi and Android are tested on their CI.

## 4. Defects
	[20%] Analyze two defects in the project--e.g. open GitHub issue, support request tickets or feature request for the project
f.	Does the issue require an architecture change, or is it just adding a new function or?
g.	 make a patch / pull request for the project to fix problem / add feature
