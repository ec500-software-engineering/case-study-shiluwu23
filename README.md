Case Study Project: Tensorflow
## 1.	Technology and Platform
a.	Language used: C++/Python
TensorFlow is designed to support multiple client languages. Currently, Python is chosen as the first well-supported language for expressing and controlling the training of models and python supports the most features. However, the core of TensorFlow is written in a combination of highly-optimized C++ and CUDA (Nvidia's language for programming GPUs).

If the project was started today, I would still use python and C++ as the coding languages. Since C++ offers speed and performance, and python is easy to integrate and itâ€™s helpful for building Machine Learning Applications from its inception to deployment.
b.	Environment needed: Anaconda.
c.	frameworks / libraries: TensorFlow, Pandas, TensorFlow-gpu, etc.
## 2.	Testing
a.	One of the easiest ways to get started using TensorFlow Serving is with Docker.
1.	[20%] Testing: describe unit/integration/module tests and the test framework
 .	How are they ensuring the testing is meaningful? Do they have code coverage metrics for example?
a.	What CI platform(s) are they using (e.g. Travis-CI, AppVeyor)?
b.	What computing platform combinations are tested on their CI? E.g. Windows 10, Cygwin, Linux, Mac, GCC, Clang

## 3. Software architecture
[20%] Software architecture in your own words, including:
 .	How would you add / edit functionality if you wanted to? How would one use this project from external projects, or is it only usable as a standalone program?
a.	What parts of the software are asynchronous (if any)?
b.	Please make diagrams as appropriate for your explanation
c.	How are separation of concerns and information hiding handled?
d.	What architectural patterns are used
e.	Does the project lean more towards object oriented or functional components
## 4. Defects
	[20%] Analyze two defects in the project--e.g. open GitHub issue, support request tickets or feature request for the project
f.	Does the issue require an architecture change, or is it just adding a new function or?
g.	 make a patch / pull request for the project to fix problem / add feature
## 5. Demonstration
